# Hello Fellas 👋 ...

## What's the weather-react-app 📱 ?

So, seems like the apps name you know that the app use to give you about weather information in many locations. In this apps, the authors create a boundary that the user only search the city that want to know. First appearence this apps will show the default background. For the temperature the author use Celcius Degreess calculation, so if the weather above 30°C the background will change.
